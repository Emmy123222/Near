## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- NEAR CLI (`npm install -g near-cli`)
- Git
- NEAR Testnet Account with some testnet NEAR tokens

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cross-chain-arbitrage-agent
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# NEAR Protocol Configuration
VITE_NEAR_CONTRACT_ID=arbitrage-ai.testnet
VITE_NEAR_NETWORK_ID=testnet
VITE_NEAR_NODE_URL=https://rpc.testnet.near.org
VITE_NEAR_WALLET_URL=https://wallet.testnet.near.org
VITE_NEAR_HELPER_URL=https://helper.testnet.near.org
VITE_NEAR_EXPLORER_URL=https://explorer.testnet.near.org

# AI Configuration (Required for AI features)
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Use different API keys for development and production
- The `.env.local` file is already included in `.gitignore`

**Getting a Groq API Key:**
1. Visit [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env.local` file
### 3. Deploy NEAR Contract

```bash
# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a new NEAR testnet account
- Deploy the smart contract
- Initialize the contract with your account
- Update environment variables automatically
- Test contract functionality

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

## üìã How It Works

### 1. **Intent Creation**
Users define their trading strategies by:
- Selecting token pairs (ETH/USDC, BTC/USDC, etc.)
- Setting minimum profit thresholds
- Configuring risk parameters
- Getting AI validation before submission
- Submitting intents to the NEAR smart contract

### 2. **Price Monitoring**
The system continuously:
- Fetches real-time prices from CoinGecko API
- Analyzes market data using Groq Cloud AI (Llama 3 8B model)
- Detects cross-chain price discrepancies with AI validation
- Provides intelligent recommendations with confidence scores
- Predicts price movements and optimal execution timing
- Validates opportunities against user intents on-chain

### 3. **Arbitrage Execution**
When opportunities are detected:
- Groq AI analyzes the opportunity with advanced algorithms
- Validates profit potential, risk factors, and market conditions
- Provides detailed reasoning and confidence scores
- Smart contract verifies user permissions and intent parameters
- Cross-chain signatures are generated and verified
- Trades are executed only with AI approval and high confidence
- All results are permanently recorded on NEAR blockchain
- Results are logged on-chain for transparency

### 4. **Profit Tracking**
All activities are recorded:
- On-chain storage of all trade data
- Trade execution details
- Profit/loss calculations
- Gas fee tracking
- Performance analytics
- Immutable audit trail on NEAR blockchain
